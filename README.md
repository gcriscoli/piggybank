# piggybank

A set of classes to manage one's own or community finance.
It's meant to enable the administrator and the individuals to keep track of their expenses (be them individual or collective) and, by them, to predict future expenses.

Each individual shall provide their own accounting information (bank accounts, credit and debit cards, cheques, cash flow) to analyse peaks and trends.
As part of a community, the system enables sharing expenses without necessarily sharing a common bank account.
