Though originally intended for use by for-profit business entities, for a number of reasons it became the main TLD for domain names and is currently used by all types of entities including nonprofits, schools, and private individuals. Domain name registrations may be successfully challenged if the holder cannot prove an outside relation justifying reservation of the name, to prevent squatting. It was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense."

.net;network;;Verisign;"This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Originally intended for use by domains pointing to a distributed network of computers, or umbrella sites that act as the portal to a set of smaller websites."
.int;international;;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority;The .int TLD is strictly limited to organizations, offices, and programs endorsed by a treaty between two or more nations. However, a few grandfathered domains do not meet these criteria.
.edu;education;;Educause (via Verisign);The .edu TLD is limited to specific higher educational institutions such as, but not limited to, trade schools and universities. In the U.S., its use was restricted in 2001 to post-secondary institutions accredited by an agency on the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies. This domain is therefore almost exclusively used by American colleges and universities. Some institutions, such as the Exploratorium, that do not meet the current registration criteria have grandfathered domain names.
